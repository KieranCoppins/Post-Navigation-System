# Getting Started with the Post Navigation System in Unity
This is a quick guide on how to get up and running with the Post Navigation System using components that come ready to use in the package

### Prerequisites
- You have Unity 2023 installed
- You have installed the Post Navigation System package by following the download instructions in the repository's readme
- You understand how to use Unity's NavMesh system and can create a NavMesh and use NavMeshAgents

### Generating post data from the navmesh
Generating post data can be done within the Unity editor. It will serialize all the post data and save it inside a scriptable object in your scenes folder. To generate post data from the NavMesh, go to the "Tools" option in the menu bar at the top of the application and find the Navigation section. As a sub option there is a button to "Generate Posts for NavMesh". Clicking this will run the post generator for generating posts from the navmesh and save the data in that scriptable object called Posts.
